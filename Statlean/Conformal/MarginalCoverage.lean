/-! # Conformal Prediction — Marginal Coverage Guarantee

The main distribution-free coverage theorem (Vovk–Shafer–Vapnik): for any
exchangeable score sequence `(S₁, …, S_{n+1})` with no ties almost surely,
the conformal prediction set built from `(S₁, …, Sₙ)` covers the test score
`S_{n+1}` with probability at least `1 − α`.

## Proof outline

1. **Rank uniformity** (`rank_uniform_of_exchangeable`, in `Conformal.Rank`):
   under exchangeability + no ties, the rank of the `(n+1)`-th coordinate
   among the full sample is uniformly distributed on `{1, …, n+1}`.
2. **Coverage event ↔ rank event** (`coverage_event_iff_rank_le`, this file):
   when there are no ties, the event `S_{n+1} ≤ Q̂_α(S₁, …, Sₙ)` (where
   `Q̂_α` is the `⌈(n+1)(1−α)⌉`-th smallest of `(S₁, …, Sₙ)`) coincides
   with `rank(S_{n+1}) ≤ ⌈(n+1)(1−α)⌉` among the full sample.
3. **Combine** (`marginal_coverage`): summing the uniform rank
   probabilities over the covering ranks gives
   `⌈(n+1)(1−α)⌉ / (n+1) ≥ 1 − α`.
4. **Upper bound** (`marginal_coverage_upper`): the same identity yields
   coverage `≤ ⌈(n+1)(1−α)⌉ / (n+1) ≤ 1 − α + 1/(n+1)`.

/-- **Coverage event ↔ rank event.** When the sample has no ties, the
point-wise event "`ω (Fin.last n)` lies below the conformal `(1−α)`-quantile
of the first `n` coordinates" coincides with "rank of `ω (Fin.last n)` is at
most `⌈(n+1)(1−α)⌉`".

This is the rank-statistic reformulation that converts the geometric
threshold `Q̂_α` into a counting statistic on which exchangeability acts. -/

/-- **Marginal coverage** (Vovk–Shafer–Vapnik, 2005, Theorem 2.1).

For an exchangeable score sequence `(ω 0, …, ω n) : Fin (n+1) → ℝ` with no
ties almost surely, the conformal prediction set built from
`(ω 0, …, ω (n-1))` covers `ω (Fin.last n)` with probability at least
`1 − α`.

This is the central distribution-free guarantee of conformal prediction:
the bound holds for every joint distribution `μ` (exchangeable, no ties)
and every score function — there is no model assumption.

/-- **Marginal coverage upper bound.** Under exchangeability + no-ties
almost surely, the conformal prediction set has coverage at most
`1 − α + 1/(n+1)`.

Together with `marginal_coverage`, this pins down the conformal coverage to
the band `[1 − α, 1 − α + 1/(n+1)]`. The slack `1/(n+1)` is intrinsic to
the discrete rank statistic and shrinks to zero as `n → ∞`. -/
